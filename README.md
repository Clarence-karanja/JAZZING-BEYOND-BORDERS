# JAZZING-BEYOND-BORDERS

## Introduction
Welcome to Jazzing Beyond Borders, an innovative project at the nexus of jazz music and multilingual speech recognition. This proof of concept delves into the intricate rhythmic dynamics of a jazz rhythm section using cutting-edge source-separated commercial audio recordings.

## Project Overview
### Purpose and Context
The Jazz Rhythm Analysis Project serves a dual purpose: unraveling the nuanced interactions within jazz performances and contributing to the Mozilla Common Voice - Machine Learning Hackathon. By tackling challenges in multilingual and cross-cultural speech recognition, we aim to transcend linguistic barriers and foster more accurate communication.

### Objectives
1. **Rhythmic Interaction Analysis:**
   - Explore and quantify the rhythmic interplay between piano, bass, and drums in jazz compositions.

2. **Source Separation Techniques:**
   - Implement advanced source separation methods to extract individual instrument tracks, revealing the distinct contributions of each musician.

3. **Visualization and Modeling:**
   - Develop visualizations and mathematical models to elucidate the degree of coupling among musicians in a jazz ensemble, offering a deeper understanding of their collaborative rhythm.

## Features
1. **Rhythmic Analysis:**
   - Analyze the intricate rhythms within jazz compositions.
   - Study how musicians synchronize and coordinate during performances.

2. **Source Separation:**
   - Utilize state-of-the-art source separation techniques.
   - Extract individual instrument tracks, focusing on piano, bass, and drums.

3. **Visualization Tools:**
   - Generate visual representations illustrating the level of synchronization and coordination among musicians.
   - Provide charts and insights for a comprehensive understanding.
