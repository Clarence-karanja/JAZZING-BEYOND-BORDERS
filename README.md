# JAZZING-BEYOND-BORDERS
# Jazz Rhythm Analysis Project

## Overview

The Jazz Rhythm Analysis Project is a proof of concept that explores the interaction within a jazz rhythm section using source-separated commercial audio recordings.
While originally designed for analyzing jazz, this project can be adapted to contribute to the Mozilla Common Voice - Machine Learning Hackathon,
addressing challenges related to multilingual and cross-cultural speech recognition.
